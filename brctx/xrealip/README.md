## How to install/update X-Real-Ip

  1. If you have an active previous version of `X Real IP`, go to the Admin Control `Panel -> Customise -> Manage extensions`
  2. Disable the extension `X Real IP` (do not click "delete data" to keep all your configured questions and answers)
  3. Delete folder `ext/brctx/xrealip`
  4. Upload the first/new version into `ext/brctx/xrealip`
  5. go to the Admin Control Panel -> Customise -> Manage extensions
  6. Enable the extension `X Real IP` (this will run the necessary migrations and event updates)
    
If you replaced the files before disabling the extension, you'll probably get an error (blank page). Restore the files of the previous version and follow the recommended update guide above.
